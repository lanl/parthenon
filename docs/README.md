# Parthenon documentation

This file provides an overview of different (not necessarily all) features in Parthenon
and how to use them.

## Building parthenon

See the [build doc](building.md) for details on building parthenon for specific systems.

## Description of examples

- [Calculate &pi;](../example/calculate_pi)
- [Average face-centered variables to cell centers](../example/face_fields)

## Short feature description

### Automated tests

Regression and convergence tests that cover the majority of features are based on the
[Advection example](../example/advection-example) and defined in the
[advection-convergence](../tst/regression/test_suites/advection_convergence) and
[output_hdf5](../tst/regression/test_suites/output_hdf5) test suites.

The tests currently cover
- advection of wave in x, y, and z direction as well oblique to the *static* grid for different resolutions to demonstrate first order convergence (see `tst/regression/outputs/advection_convergence/advection-errors.png` file in the build directory after running the test)
- Advection of a smoothed sphere at an angle on a *static* grid, on a *static* grid a twice the resolution, and with *AMR* covering the sphere at the effective higher resolution
- Advection of a sharp sphere at an angle with *AMR* writing hdf5 output and comparing against a gold standard output.

To execute the tests run, e.g.,
```bash
# from within the build directory (add -V fore more detailed output)
ctest -R regression
```
The gold standard files (reference solutions) used in the regression tests should automatically be downloaded during the configure phase.
Alternatively, you can download them as a release from [GitHub](https://github.com/lanl/parthenon/releases/)
and extract the contents of the archive to `PARTHENON_ROOT/tst/regression/gold_standard` directory.
Make sure to get the correct version matching your source
(stored in the `REGRESSION_GOLD_STANDARD_VER` CMake variable).
Note: If you results are (slightly) different, that may stem from using different
compiler/optimization options.

In case you adds new tests that require reference data just put all file in the `PARTHENON_ROOT/tst/regression/gold_standard` directory and either
- increase the version integer by one (both in the `PARTHENON_ROOT/tst/regression/gold_standard/current_version` file and in the
`PARTHENON_ROOT/CMakeLists.txt` file), or
- configure with `REGRESSION_GOLD_STANDARD_SYNC=OFF`.
The former is considered the safer option as it prevents accidental overwriting of those files during configure
(as `REGRESSION_GOLD_STANDARD_SYNC` is `ON` by default).
In the pull request of the suggested changes we will then update the official gold standard release file and appropriate hash prior to merging.

### ParthenonManager

This class provides a streamlined capability to write new applications by providing a simple interface to initialize and finalize a simulation.  It's usage is straightforward and demonstrated in the &pi; [example](../example/calculate_pi/calculate_pi.cpp).

There are several weakly linked member functions that applications can (and often should) override to specialize:
* ParthenonManager::ProcessProperties
  * Constructs and returns a Properties_t object that is often filled with runtime specified (i.e. determined from the input file) settings and parameters.  For example, this might hold an equation of state.
* ParthenonManager::ProcessPackages
  * Constructs and returns a Packages_t object that contains a listing of all the variables and their metadata associated with each package.
* ParthenonManager::SetFillDerivedFunctions
  * Each package can register a function pointer in the Packages_t object that provides a callback mechanism for derived quantities (e.g. velocity, from momentum and mass) to be filled.  Additionally, this function provides a mechanism to register functions to fill derived quantities before and/or after all the individual package calls are made.  This is particularly useful for derived quantities that are shared by multiple packages.

### Error checking

Macros for causing execution to throw an exception are provided [here](../src/utils/error_checking.hpp)
* PARTHENON_REQUIRE(condition, message) exits if the condition does not evaluate to true.
* PARTHENON_REQUIRE_THROWS(condition, message) throws a `std::runtime_error` exception if the condition does not evaluate to true.
* PARTHENON_FAIL(message) always exits.
* PARTHENON_THROW(message) throws a runtime error.
* PARTHENON_DEBUG_REQUIRE(condition, message) exits if the condition does not evaluate to true when in debug mode.
* PARTHENON_DEBUG_REQUIRE_THROWS(condition, message) throws if the condition does not evaluate to true when in debug mode.
* PARTHENON_DEBUG_FAIL(message) always exits when in debug mode.
* PARTHENON_DEBUG_THROW(message) throws a runtime error when in debug mode.

All macros print the message, and filename and line number where the
macro is called. PARTHENON_REQUIRE also prints the condition. The
macros take a `std::string`, a `std::stringstream`, or a C-style
string. As a rule of thumb:
- Use the exception throwing versions in non-GPU, non-performance critical code.
- On GPUs and in performance-critical sections, use the non-throwing
  versions and give them C-style strings.

### Developer guide

Please see the [full development guide](development.md) on how to use Kokkos-based
performance portable abstractions available within Parthenon and how to write
performance portable code.

### State Management
[Full Documentation](interface/state.md)

Parthenon provides a convenient means of managing simulation data. Variables can be registered
with Parthenon to have the framework automatically manage the field, including
updating ghost cells, prolongation, restriction, and I/O.

### Application Drivers

A description of the Parthenon-provided classes that facilitate developing the high-level functionality of an application (e..g. time stepping) can be found [here](driver.md).

### Adaptive Mesh Refinement

A description of how to enable and extend the AMR capabilities of Parthenon is provided [here](amr.md).

### Tasks

The tasking capabilities in Parthenon are documented [here](tasks.md).

### Outputs

Check [here](outputs.md) for a description of how to get data out of Parthenon and how to visualize it.

### Containers and Container Iterators

See [here](interface/containers.md) for a description of containers,
container iterators, and variable packs.

### Index Shape and Index Range

A description of mesh indexing classes [here](mesh/domain.md).
