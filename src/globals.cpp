//  \brief namespace containing global variables.
//
// Yes, we all know global variables should NEVER be used, but in fact they are ideal for,
// e.g., global constants that are set once and never changed.  To prevent name collisions
// global variables are wrapped in their own namespace.

#include "globals.hpp"
#include "defs.hpp"

namespace parthenon {
namespace Globals {

// all of these global variables are set at the start of main():
int my_rank; // MPI rank of this process
int nranks;  // total number of MPI ranks

} // namespace Globals
