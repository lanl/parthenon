        Any preprocessing that is needed before the drive is run can be done in
        this method

        This includes preparing files or any other pre processing steps that
        need to be implemented.  The method also provides access to the
        parameters object which controls which parameters are being used to run
        the driver. 

        It is possible to append arguments to the driver_cmd_line_args if it is
        desired to  override the parthenon input file. Each element in the list
        is simply a string of the form '<block>/<field>=<value>', where the
        contents of the string are exactly what one would type on the command
        line run running a parthenon driver.

        any of the parameters that were specified in the parthenon input file

        This function is called after the driver has been executed. It is
        responsible for reading whatever data it needs and making a judgment

        be True (test passes) or False (test fails).
